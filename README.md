# Access-Point-Load-Aware-User-Association
This document outlines a research project titled "Access Point Load Aware User Association Using Reinforcement Learning." The study addresses the challenge of uneven network traffic distribution across multiple Wi-Fi access points in high-density environments. The proposed solution leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize the user association process by considering signal strength and access point load, ultimately improving network performance and reducing congestion. Key concepts include RSSI, Q-learning, and user equipment policies.
